chat.py is where the chatbot can be executed
If you have problems with torch and stuff, don't worry
All you have to do is make the intents.json file better
Add riddles,more games and jokes

If you have a game like tic-tac-toa that chetna made last year, you can add the files, and reference how i made
the hangman game and the rock_paper_scissor work and implement that

todo AFTER YOU MAKE CHANGES TO THE JSON FILE, YOU MUST RUN THE TRAIN.PY FILE

I named the chatbot BayMax(cause why not), but if u wanna change it, you can.

You could make tiny math games or something, or come up with something i haven't even thought of

Have fun
